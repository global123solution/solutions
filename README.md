PCA
Given a set of data X =

2 3 3 4 5 7
2 4 5 5 6 8
1. Calculate the eigenvalues of XT X by code or calculators. (Do not
subtract mean or normalize data)
2. Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of XXT
. Solve this by hand
AND using code you implement to verify your solution. (Do not subtract mean or normalize data) (Note that all eigenvectors need to be
normalized.)
3. Are the non-zero eigenvalues of XT X and those of XXT
the same? Why
or why not?
4. For dataset X, there are 6 samples with 2 dimensions. Reduce X dimensions to 1. Print/write the reduced 1-dimension data. It should be a 1 ×6
vector. Solve this by hand AND using code you implement to verify your
solution. (Please subtract mean and normalize data.)
